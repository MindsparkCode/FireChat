 Chatting Apps built using Realtime NoSQL Firebase Database + Firebase Authentication

Chat or Chat is the style of young people today. Before the chat most people prefer to SMS. But the feature of SMS is very limited, this is what developers think the apps to create an application similar to SMS, but has features that are far superior. And in the end emerged Android Chatting Applications Diverse as it is today.

This application I created to show the concept of sending messages using chat applications and the use of two firebase features of the features NoSQL realtime database and Email Authentication
